#Iowa Climate Calendar
##What is it?
A Drupal(7.x)/Angular(1.4) based site for listing climate change related events. It supports filtering of the events by proximity to
a zip code, filtering by event type, and subscribing to a weekly email of the climate events. Additionally, event 
administrator accounts can be created so multiple people can add events to the site. Currently it's configured for the
state of Iowa, but can easily be customized for other states.

##Caveats
This site was written quickly with no tests and little refactoring. Sorry!

##Installation
Set up the site with your webserver and install Drupal. It should default to the Iowa Climate Calendar profile.
