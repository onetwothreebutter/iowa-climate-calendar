#Iowa Climate Calendar
##What is it?
A Drupal(7.x)/Angular(1.4) based site for listing climate change related events. It supports filtering of the events by proximity to
a zip code, filtering by event type, and subscribing to a weekly email of the climate events. Additionally, event 
administrator accounts can be created so multiple people can add events to the site.

##Caveats
This was written quickly with no tests and little refactoring. Sorry!
